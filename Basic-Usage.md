# Basic Usage

## Create User

This step-by-step tutorial will show you how to create your first training model
from user creation to the analysis of the final results. The first step is to
enter the Lemonade homepage, in it, you can read more about the project as shown
in the image bellow. By clicking `SIGN UP` you will be redirected to write in
some data for your user. If you already have done this step, use the `LOGIN`
button to sign in with an existing user.

Insert the requested data, as the example in the image bellow, then click `SIGN
UP` to finalize the process. It is important to note that you can change
this information later with the exception of e-mail address.

After the creation you will see your home page, which allows quick access to the
projects you will create. For this reason, it is possible to customize the cards
that appear, as well as their position and size. This is done by simply dragging
the cards. To add a new one, simply use the `+` button, located in the lower right
corner of the screen, and select the desired card. As to delete, there is a
trash button in each card in the upper right.

At the moment, the cards are blank, but throughout the tutorial you will be able
to better visualize their functions. By the time the general concepts behind
each one of them will be presented:

- Basic tutorial -> Explanatory video covering the basics for using lemonade.
- Latest updated workflows -> Shows the most recently created workflows, which are
  composed of blocks linked together according to the logic of the experiment
  being executed. Each block also contains parameters to adapt them and
  therefore use them in several different assemblies.
- Latest updated jobs -> Shows the most recently created jobs, which are generated
  from the execution of the workflow. Therefore they contain the results or error
  messages related to the experiment. 
- Release notes -> Notes about the platform version.
- Latest updated dashboards -> Shows the most recently created dashboards, which
  groups the result views of a workflow.
- Latest updated datasources -> Shows the most recently created datasources,
  which are used in workflows.

In addition to this overview, you can access more options for workflows, jobs,
dashboards, and datasources through the side tab on the left side of the screen.
Each of the screens will be better explained as they are used in this tutorial.

As previously stated, you can edit the user information. To do this click on
your name in the upper right corner of the screen and then on `Profile`. In this
screen you can also choose the language.
