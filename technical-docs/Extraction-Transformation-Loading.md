# Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL)


## Use case: Using Open Payments data plus SQL

[Open Payments](https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/) is a federal program, 
required by the Affordable Care Act, that collects information about the 
payments drug and device companies make to physicians and teaching hospitals 
for things like travel, research, gifts, speaking fees, and meals. It also 
includes ownership interests that physicians or their immediate family members 
have in these companies.  This data is then made available to the public each 
year on this website. 

## Getting data

Data is available at http://download.cms.gov/openpayments/PGYR16_P063017.ZIP.
