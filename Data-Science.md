# Data science

Data Science arises as a new area that aims to materialize processes and practices to explore, analyze and generate models that enable the description and prediction from a wide range of data types. Ultimately, these processes and practices will support better performance and efficacy of the organizations and quality of life of the citizens.

Data Science models and transforms data to subsidize the decision process through computational thinking, towards data-driven decision making.
